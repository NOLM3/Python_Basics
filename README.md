## Introduction

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to be easy to understand and use, making it an ideal choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## What You Should Already Know

To get the most out of this documentation, it's helpful to be familiar with a few basic concepts. While this guide is designed to be beginner-friendly, prior knowledge of certain topics can help you understand the concepts more easily and apply them efficiently.

## Strings and Print Function

Python provides a powerful way to work with strings and print output to the console. In this section, we cover how to use strings and the `print()` function.

## Reserved Words

In Python, reserved words are keywords that have special meaning. These cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.).

## Variables and Rules

Variables in Python are used to store data. You donâ€™t need to declare their type beforehand, as Python is dynamically typed.

## Numeric Expressions

Numeric expressions are fundamental in Python. You can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Order of Evaluation

When writing expressions in Python, the order in which they are evaluated can affect the result.

## String to Int/Float Conversion

Python allows you to easily convert strings to integers or floats. This is essential when working with user input or processing data from files.

## Indentation and Deindentation

Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Proper indentation is crucial to avoid syntax errors.

## Control Flow

Control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif` allow you to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
